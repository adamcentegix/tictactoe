This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python.

## Features

- ASCII art game board
- Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file using Python:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. Players take turns entering row and column numbers (0-2) to place their mark (X or O) on the board.
3. The game ends when a player wins by getting three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the board is full (resulting in a tie).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the entire game logic
- `README.md`: This file, containing information about the project
